[capture](parameter_list) -> return_type { body }

Capture Clause [capture]:
– The capture clause defines how variables from the surrounding scope (outside the
lambda) are made available inside the lambda function.
– It can capture variables by reference (allowing modifications to the original
variables) or by value (capturing a copy of the variable).
• Parameter List (parameter list):
– This is where you define the parameters the lambda takes, similar to a regular
function. If the lambda does not take any parameters, the parentheses can be left
empty.
• Return Type -> return type:
– The return type is optional. If omitted, C++ will automatically deduce the return type
based on the return statements inside the lambda. However, you can explicitly
specify the return type if needed, especially in cases where the type is unclear or
complex.
• Body { body }:
– The body contains the code that is executed when the lambda is invoked. Inside the
body, you can use the captured variables and the function parameters.

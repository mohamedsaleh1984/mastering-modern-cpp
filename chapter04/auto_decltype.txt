The advent of auto and decltype in C++11 marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of C++.
These features significantly simplify code by letting the compiler automatically deduce types.
With auto and decltype, developers can write cleaner and more maintainable code that is less
error-prone, especially when dealing with complicated templates or long and intricate type
declarations. These tools enhance code flexibility, allowing for more general and reusable
solutions.
